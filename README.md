# iwocmnmap - A prison map of MN with additional data
### Description
A map showing the prisons in MN fed by a private gDoc spreadsheet. A friend volunteers for Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) MN, and she needed a consolidated source of info for prisons. It needed to be simple for her to update the information as needed, hence the use of gDocs. What's live and public is a dev version of the spreadsheet to maintain privacy.
